<!-- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style and layout HTML elements -->

<!-- There are three primary ways to apply CSS to an HTML document: 

Inline CSS Inline CSS is used to apply styles directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. This method is not recommended for large projects due to its lack of scalability and maintainability.


Internal CSS Internal CSS is used by placing CSS rules within a style tag inside the head section of the HTML document. This method is useful for styling a single HTML document.


External CSS External CSS is applied by linking a separate CSS file using the link tag in the head section of the HTML document. This method is preferred for larger projects as it promotes reusability and separation of concerns. -->
